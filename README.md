# plugin-extensions

== Plugins that extend my WordPress plug-ins in various ways. ==

Every file in this repository can be installed as a plug-in. When installed, it'll perform some action that modifies or extends the behavior of one of my other plug-ins. The files are grouped into folders that should make it clear which plug-in they pertain to. 

With the plug-ins that have premium extensions, such as WP Tweets PRO for WP to Twitter, some of these extensions will only do anything when the premium add-on is also installed. 

These aren't really full-scale plug-ins; these are examples of how you can use the filters and actions in my plug-ins to extend or customize their functionality.

Thanks!
